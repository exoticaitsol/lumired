Red and near-infrared light promotes cellular growth of healthy muscle tissue and muscle hypertrophy, helping users achieve their results.<br\/><br\/>In endurance based sports, a 2018 trial concluded that \"engaging in red light therapy before exercise increases oxygen uptake, increases how long volunteers could exercise before hitting the point of exhaustion and significantly improves fat loss.”<br\/><br\/>Due to its anti-oxidation effect on cells, muscle fatigue reduces and heat hormones increase, safeguarding cells against chronic oxidation, mutations, decay and eventual cell death.
