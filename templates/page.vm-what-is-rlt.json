The results were inspiring and fruitful, and RLT continues to be researched and used today to aid in pain relief, tissue repair, and muscle improvement.<br\/><br\/>Chronic pain is an unfortunate staple in the lives of many people. This impediment to daily life comes in many forms such as arthritis, inflammation, or chronic pain, among others.

Red Light Therapy isn’t only for athletes; it’s an advantageous process that anyone who experiences chronic pain, exercises regularly, or is in the process of losing weight can utilise. RLT improves blood flow, meaning your muscles receive more blood and they perform better. Increased blood flow will also lead to muscle tissue healing quicker and thus, be able to endure more strain.<br\/><\/p><p>Red and near-infrared light increases the growth of cells.
